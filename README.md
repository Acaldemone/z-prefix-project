## Overview

The Inventory Management System is a web application that allows users to manage their inventory of items. The system provides functionalities for accessing the inventory without being logged in, creating an account, and logging in. Once logged in, users can add, modify, and delete items from their inventory. The same functionality persists if you arent logged in.

## Features

Add Items: Any user can add an Item. (note Logged on users cannot add items at this time, It causes the server to crash)

Delete Items: Any user can delete an Item.
